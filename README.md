Automatic Identification Systems for Smart Manufacturing Applications

Automatic identification systems (AIDC - Automatic Identification and Data Capture)
have been assuming an increasingly important role in the “Smart manufacturing – Industry 4.0” concept.

This project was carried out within the scope of the curricular unit “Capstone Project” from the 3rd year of the Bachelor in Electrical and Computers Engineering,
the goal was to develop a demonstrator of some of the most important industrial identification technologies, namely Industrial Vision and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification).

At the end of the semester the present work was evaluated with 16 values.
